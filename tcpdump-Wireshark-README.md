# TCPDump & Wireshark Packet Captures

This repository contains traffic captures taken from controlled local environments using `tcpdump` and analyzed in Wireshark. Each file includes observations and breakdowns to help understand packet structures, network behavior, and potential indicators of compromise.

## üîç What's Inside

- `.pcap` files captured via `tcpdump`
- Screenshots and notes from Wireshark analysis
- Explanations of key packet fields (e.g., headers, flags, source/destination IPs)
- Commentary on network activity patterns
- Occasional links to MITRE ATT&CK tactics or known behaviors if applicable

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand how different protocols (TCP, UDP, DNS, ARP, ICMP) behave at the packet level
- Practice identifying packet sequences and flag behavior
- Explore how attackers might be detected through traffic anomalies
- Gain comfort with `tcpdump` syntax and filtering
- Build Wireshark proficiency for real-world traffic analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Notice

All captures were performed in private or sandboxed environments.  
This repository is for **educational purposes only** and does not contain or encourage analysis of unauthorized traffic.
